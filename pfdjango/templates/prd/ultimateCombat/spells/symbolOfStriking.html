				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>School </b>illusion (shadow); <b>Level </b>cleric 5, magus 5, sorcerer/wizard 5, witch 5</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Components</b> V, S, M (a masterwork melee weapon costing at least 300 gp)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Saving Throw</b> Will half, see text; <b>Spell Resistance</b> yes, see text</p>
				<p class="stat-description-2">This spell functions like <i><a href="../../spells/symbolOfDeath.html#symbol-of-death" >symbol of death</a></i>, except that using the material component, you scribe a <i><a href="#symbol-of-striking" >symbol of striking</a></i> so it fills a 5-foot square. Once triggered, the <i><a href="#symbol-of-striking" >symbol of striking</a></i> glows and lasts for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has made a number of attacks of opportunity equal to your level, whichever comes first. When triggered, the symbol threatens its area and the area around it as if it were a Medium creature wielding a magic version of the weapon you used as the material component. Using your caster level + 1 + your Intelligence modifier (magus, witch, wizard) or Wisdom modifier (cleric) or Charisma modifier (oracle, sorcerer) as its attack bonus, the symbol can make a number of attacks of opportunity each round equal to 1 + the same ability score modifier you used to determine its attack bonus. It gains a bonus on damage rolls equal to the same ability score modifier you used to determine its attack bonus. A shadowy version of you wielding the material component appears to make these attacks. </p>
				<p class="stat-description-indent-1">The symbol attacks any non-attuned creature that provokes an attack of opportunity from the symbol<i>.</i> However, when the symbol first attacks a creature, the symbol must overcome that creature's spell resistance or be rendered unable to harm it. The symbol never again attacks such creatures. Further, when the symbol first attacks a creature, a successful Will saving throw allows the creature to see the shadow nature of the attacks and take half damage when such attacks hit.</p>

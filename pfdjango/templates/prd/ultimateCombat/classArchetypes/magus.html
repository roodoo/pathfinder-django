				<h1 id="magus">Magus</h1>
				
				
				<p>A master of arcane magic fused with more conventional weapon attacks, the magus typically seeks balance in both approaches. Many of the archetypes and new magus arcana presented in this section supplement those magi who favor their feats of arms over raw spellcasting power. More so than other magi, these combat-oriented arcanists use their magical arts to empower their weapon attacks and defenses. </p>
				<h2 id="magus-arcana">Magus Arcana</h2>
				<p>As he gains levels, a magus masters arcane secrets that supplement his magical and martial attacks. Any magus who meets the prerequisites listed in a magus arcana's description can select that arcana. Unless specifically noted in a magus arcana's description, a magus cannot select a particular magus arcana more than once. Magus arcana that affect spells can only be used to modify spells from the magus spell list unless otherwise noted in their descriptions. </p>
				<p id="accurate-strike"><i>Accurate Strike (Ex)</i>: The magus can expend 2 points from his arcane pool as a swift action to resolve all of his melee weapon attacks until the end of his turn as melee touch attacks. The magus must be at least 9th level before selecting this arcana.</p>

This bonus lasts for 1 minute.</p>
				<p id="arcane-edge"><i>Arcane Edge (Su)</i>: The magus can expend 1 point from his arcane pool as an immediate action after hitting a target with a slashing or piercing weapon in order to deal an amount of bleed damage equal to his Intelligence modifier (minimum 0).

				<p id="arcane-redoubt"><i>Arcane Redoubt (Su)</i>: As a swift action, the magus can expend 1 point from his arcane pool to treat his shield bonus to AC (including any enhancement bonus) as a bonus to touch AC until the beginning of his next turn.</p>
				<p id="arcane-redoubt,-greater"><i>Arcane Redoubt, Greater (Su)</i>: Whenever the magus uses his arcane redoubt magus arcana, he may spend an additional point from his arcane pool in order to apply his shield bonus to AC (including any enhancement bonus) as a bonus on Reflex saves until the beginning of his next turn. If he is targeted with an effect requiring a Reflex save while using this power, he may spend 2 points from his arcane pool as an immediate action to grant himself evasion, or 4 points to grant himself improved evasion. The magus must have the arcane redoubt magus arcana and be at least 12th level to select this magus arcana.</p>
				<p id="bane-blade"><i>Bane Blade (Su)</i>: Whenever the magus enhances his weapon using his arcane pool, he may spend 1 additional point from his arcane pool to add the <i><a href="../../magicItems/weapons.html#weapons-bane" >bane</a></i> special ability to the weapon.

				<p id="pool-strike,-clinging"><i>Pool Strike, Clinging (Su)</i>: The magus can expend 1 additional point from his arcane pool when making a pool strike.

				<h2 id="kensai-(archetype)">Kensai (Archetype)</h2>
				<p>A kensai spends his life focusing his training and meditation into a rapturous perfection of the use of a single weapon, which is usually but not always a sword, channeling his arcane might through it in a dizzying and deadly dance beyond the abilities of even the greatest of mundane warriors. </p>
				<p id="weapon-and-armor-proficiency"><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>: A kensai is proficient in simple weapons and in a single martial or exotic melee weapon of his choice. A kensai is not proficient with armor or shields and suffers normal arcane spell failure chance when casting magus spells while armored.</p>

				<p id="weapon-focus"><b>Weapon Focus (Ex)</b>: At 1st level, a kensai gains <a href="../../feats.html#weapon-focus" >Weapon Focus</a> with his chosen weapon as a bonus feat.</p>
				<p id="perfect-strike">Perfect Strike (Ex)</b>: At 4th level, when a kensai hits with his chosen weapon, he can spend 1 point from his arcane pool in order to maximize his weapon damage. Don't roll for damage&mdash;the weapon deals maximum damage. This affects only the weapon's base damage dice, not additional damage from sneak attack, magical weapon properties, spellstrike, or critical hits. </p>
				<p>If the kensai confirms a critical hit, he can instead spend 2 points from his arcane pool to increase his weapon's critical multiplier by 1. This ability replaces spell recall.</p>
				<p id="fighter-training"><b>Fighter Training (Ex)</b>: Starting at 7th level, a kensai counts his magus level &ndash;3 as his fighter level for the purpose of qualifying for feats (if he has levels in fighter, these levels stack), but forfeits the benefit of such feats with weapons other than his favored weapon. This ability replaces knowledge pool.</p>
				<p id="iaijutsu"><b>Iaijutsu (Ex)</b>: At 7th level, a kensai applies his Intelligence modifier as well as his Dexterity modifier on initiative rolls (minimum 0). A kensai may make attacks of opportunity when flat-footed, and may draw his favored weapon as a free action as part of taking an attack of opportunity. This ability replaces the medium armor ability.</p>
				<p id="critical-perfection"><b>Critical Perfection (Ex)</b>: At 9th level, a kensai adds his Intelligence bonus (minimum 0) on critical hit confirmation rolls with his favored weapon.

				<p id="iaijutsu-master"><b>Iaijutsu Master (Ex)</b>: At 19th level, a kensai's initiative roll is automatically a natural 20 and he is never surprised. This ability replaces greater spell access.</p>

				<p id="weapon-training"><b>Weapon Training (Ex)</b>: At 6th level, a myrmidarch gains weapon training, as the fighter ability, adding an additional weapon group every six levels after 6th (to a maximum of three groups at 18th level) and increasing the bonus on attack and damage rolls for weapon groups already chosen by +1.

				<p id="arcane-bond"><b>Arcane Bond (Su)</b>: At 1st level, a skirnir gains a shield (except for a tower shield) as an arcane bond item. This is identical to the wizard class ability, but the skirnir may only bond with a shield, not a familiar or other item. </p>
				<p id="arcane-pool"><b>Arcane Pool</b>: At 1st level, a skirnir can use his arcane pool to grant an enhancement bonus to a weapon as normal, as well as to his shield, paying the arcane pool cost separately for each.

				<p id="../../spellshield"><b>Spellshield (Su)</b>: At 7th level, as a standard action, a skirnir may store a magus spell in his shield by spending 1 point from his arcane pool per level of the spell. This functions as the <i><a href="../../magicItems/weapons.html#spell-storing" >spell storing</a></i> weapon special ability, but activates only on a successful shield bash by the skirnir and is not limited to spells of 3rd level or less. This ability replaces knowledge pool.</p>
				<p id="shielded-spell-combat"><b>Shielded Spell Combat (Su)</b>: At 8th level, a skirnir gains the spell combat ability, but only when wielding his bonded shield. A skirnir may use his shield hand to perform somatic components for magus spells, forfeiting the shield's bonus to AC until the beginning of his next turn; if the bonded shield is a buckler, he retains its bonus to AC.

This bonus applies on skill checks required when using <a href="../../feats.html#craft-magic-arms-and-armor" >Craft Magic Arms and Armor</a>.</p>
				<p>At 7th level, a soul forger uses the 1/10 gp value of armor, shields, and weapons to determine how much time it takes to craft mundane items, and he requires only half the normal amount of time to enchant magical arms and armor. This ability replaces knowledge pool.</p>
				<p id="fortify-bond"><b>Fortify Bond (Su)</b>: At 4th level, a soul forger may spend 1 point from his arcane pool to increase the hardness and hit points of his bonded item by an amount equal to his magus level.

				<p id="reforge"><b>Reforge (Su)</b>: At 11th level, as a standard action, a soul forger can restore a number of hit points equal to his magus level to a damaged object by touching it and spending 1 point from his arcane pool.

				<p>Restoring the enchantments of a destroyed magical item requires additional points from the soul forger's arcane pool equal to the item's caster level.

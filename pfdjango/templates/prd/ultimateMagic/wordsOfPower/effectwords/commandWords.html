				<h2 id="command-words">Command Words</h2>
				<p>These words demand action from those that hear them, with near-irresistible force.</p>
				<p id="friendship-(command)" class="stat-block-title">Friendship (Command)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>School </b>enchantment (charm) [mind-affecting]; <b>Level </b>bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1, witch 1</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Duration</b> 10 minutes/level</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Saving Throw </b>Will negates; <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Target Restrictions </b><i>selected</i></p>
				<p>The target of a wordspell with this effect word treats the caster as a trusted ally. The creature will defend the caster and will not attack the caster's allies while the wordspell persists. If the creature is attacked by the caster or his allies, this effect immediately ends (though other effects of the wordspell may continue). A wordspell with this effect word only affects creatures of the humanoid type; targets receive a +4 bonus on the saving throw if a wordspell with the effect word has its target boosted to affect more than one creature.</p>
				<p id="simple-order-(command)" class="stat-block-title">Simple Order (Command)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>School </b>enchantment (compulsion) [language-dependent, mind affecting]; <b>Level </b>bard 1, cleric 1, inquisitor 1, sorcerer/wizard 1, <br/>witch 1</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Duration</b> 1 round</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Saving Throw </b>Will negates; <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Target Restrictions</b> <i>selected</i></p>
				<p>The target of a wordspell with this effect word must follow one of five simple commands to the best of its ability on its next turn. If the target cannot take the specified action on its next turn, this effect of the wordspell fails. The possible commands are as follows.</p>
				<p class="stat-block-2"><i>Approach</i>: The target must move toward the caster as quickly and directly as possible, provoking attacks of opportunity as normal. The target avoids obvious hazards, such as fire, pits, or traps that it is aware of (other creatures do not count).</p>
				<p class="stat-block-2"><i>Drop</i>: The target drops whatever it is holding and does not pick up anything this round. It can otherwise act normally.</p>
				<p class="stat-block-2"><i>Fall</i>: The target falls to the ground and remains prone until its next turn. It can otherwise act normally.</p>
				<p class="stat-block-2"><i>Flee</i>: The target moves away from the caster as quickly and directly as possible. This otherwise functions as approach.</p>
				<p class="stat-block-2"><i>Halt</i>: The target does not move and takes no other action on its turn, although it is not considered flat-footed or helpless.</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Boost</b>: This wordspell can use any target word. Boosting this effect word increases its level by 3.</p>
				<p id="complex-order-(command)" class="stat-block-title">Complex Order (Command)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>School </b>enchantment (compulsion) [language-dependent, mind affecting]; <b>Level </b>bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 4</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Duration</b> 10 minutes/level</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Saving Throw </b>Will negates; <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Target Restrictions</b> <i>selected</i></p>
				<p>The target of a wordspell with this effect word must follow the wordcaster's instructions. The wordcaster must be able to convey the orders within 1 round and the actions must be possible to complete within the wordspell's duration. The instructions cannot include anything that is obviously dangerous or harmful to the target. The instructions do not have to take the entire duration, and once completed, a wordspell with this effect word ends. If the instructions are not completed by the time the duration expires, the target is under no compulsion to finish enacting them.</p>
				<p id="crush-will-(command)" class="stat-block-title">Crush Will (Command)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>School </b>enchantment (compulsion) [language-dependant, mind-affecting]; <b>Level </b>bard 4, sorcerer/wizard 5, witch 5</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Duration</b> 1 round/level</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Saving Throw </b>Will negates; <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Target Restrictions </b><i>selected</i></p>
				<p>The target of a wordspell with this effect word obeys any commands given by the caster. These commands are sent through a mental link that does not require speech. The target ignores any commands that are suicidal or self-destructive. A wordspell with this effect word only affects creatures of the humanoid type; targets receive a +4 bonus on the saving throw if a wordspell with the effect word has its target boosted to affect more than one creature.</p>

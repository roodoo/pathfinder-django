				<p>Words from this family cause objects to become stationary and creatures to become paralyzed.</p>
				<p id="lock-ward-(binding)" class="stat-block-title">Lock Ward (Binding)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>School </b>abjuration; <b>Level </b>sorcerer/wizard 1</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Duration</b> permanent</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Saving Throw </b>Will negates (harmless); <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes (harmless)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Target Restrictions </b><i>selected</i></p>
				<p>This effect word causes one unattended object to close, such as a door, chest, or book. If the object possesses a lock, the object is also locked. If the wordspell includes other effect words, the effects of those words are suspended until a creature other than the wordcaster attempts to unlock or otherwise open the object. That creature becomes the target of the other effect words, as if those effect words had the <i>selected</i> target word. Only consider the other effect words when determining the duration of this secondary effect. </p>
				<p id="paralyze-humanoid-(binding)" class="stat-block-title">Paralyze Humanoid (Binding)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>School </b>enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; <b>Level </b>bard 2, cleric 2, inquisitor 2, sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 2</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Duration</b> 1 round/level</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Saving Throw </b>Will negates; <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Target Restrictions </b><i>selected</i></p>
				<p>The target of a wordspell with this effect word is paralyzed and cannot move. It is aware and can breathe normally, but cannot take any actions. At the end of each of the creature's turns, it can attempt a new saving throw to end the effect. Flying creatures that rely on wings to fly fall, and swimmers cannot swim and may drown. Wordspells with this effect word only affect creatures of the humanoid type.</p>
				<p id="paralyze-creature-(binding)" class="stat-block-title">Paralyze Creature (Binding)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>School </b>enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; <b>Level <br/></b>bard 4, druid 4, inquisitor 4, sorcerer/wizard 5, summoner 5, <br/>witch 5</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Duration</b> 1 round/level</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Saving Throw </b>Will negates; <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Target Restrictions </b><i>selected</i></p>
				<p>This effect word functions as the <i>paralyze humanoid </i>word except that it can affect creatures of any type.</p>
				<p id="permanent-paralysis-(binding)" class="stat-block-title">Permanent Paralysis (Binding)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>School </b>enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; <b>Level </b>sorcerer/wizard 8, summoner 6, witch 8</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Duration</b> permanent</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Saving Throw </b>Will negates; <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Target Restrictions </b><i>selected</i></p>
				<p>This effect word functions as the <i>paralyze humanoid </i>word except that it can affect creatures of any type and the duration is permanent. A creature affected by a wordspell with this effect word receives one additional Will saving throw at the end of its first turn after initially failing the save. This saving throw is made to relieve this word's effects, not any others included in the original wordspell. If this save fails as well, the effect of this word can only be undone with <i><a href="../../../spells/dispelMagic.html#dispel-magic-greater" >greater dispel magic</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../spells/miracle.html#miracle" >miracle</a></i>, or <i><a href="../../../spells/wish.html#wish" >wish</a></i>.</p>

				<h2 id="language-words">Language Words</h2>
				<p>Words from this family deal with language and help with communication.</p>
				<p id="decipher-(language)" class="stat-block-title">Decipher (Language)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>School </b>divination; <b>Level </b>alchemist 1, bard 0, cleric 0, druid 0, inquisitor 0, magus 0, paladin 1, ranger 1, sorcerer/wizard 0, summoner 0, witch 0</p>

				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Saving Throw </b>none; <b>Spell Resistance </b>no</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Target Restrictions </b><i>personal</i></p>
				<p>The target of a wordspell with this effect word can read text written in one particular language, including the language of magic. The caster picks the language when the wordspell is cast. For the duration, the target can read that language as if fluent in it. If the caster chooses magic as the language, the target can decipher scrolls, glyphs, and other magic writing without triggering them. A wordspell with this effect word does not impart the ability to determine what a given language is based on its appearance; the caster must already know the language or guess what language the writing is in to do so.</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Boost</b>: This effect word can use the <i>selected</i> target word. Boosting this effect word increases its level by 1.</p>
				<p id="translate-(language)" class="stat-block-title">Translate (Language)</p>

				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Saving Throw </b>Will negates (harmless); <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes (harmless)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Target Restrictions </b><i>selected</i></p>
				<p>The target of a wordspell with this effect word can read, write, speak, and understand one particular language, chosen by the caster. The language can be any that the caster is aware of, even racial languages.</p>
				<p id="far-casting-(language)" class="stat-block-title">Far Casting (Language)</p>

				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Saving Throw </b>none; <b>Spell Resistance </b>no</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Target Restrictions </b><i>personal</i></p>
				<p>The target of a wordspell with this effect word can reach out to another willing creature that the target knows of and that is on the same plane of existence as the target. As long as the wordcaster concentrates, the target can communicate verbally with the willing creature, and the willing creature can communicate back. The target and the willing creature do not need to share a language to communicate in this way.</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Boost</b>: This word can use the <i>selected</i> target word. Boosting this effect word increases its level by 1.</p>

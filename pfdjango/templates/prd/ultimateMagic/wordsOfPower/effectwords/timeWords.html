				<h2 id="time-words">Time Words</h2>
				<p>Spells containing time words alter the flow of time, speeding it up or slowing it down.</p>

				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>School </b>transmutation; <b>Level </b>alchemist 2, bard 2, magus 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, summoner 2</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Duration</b> 1 round/level</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Saving Throw </b>Will negates (harmless); <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes (harmless)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Target Restrictions </b><i>selected</i></p>
				<p>The target of a wordspell with this effect word can take one additional move action each turn. This move action can come before, after, or between other actions, but not during a full-round action.</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Boost</b>: If the target takes a full-attack action, it can, instead of taking an extra move action, make one additional attack at its highest attack bonus.</p>
				<p id="decelerate-(time)" class="stat-block-title">Decelerate (Time)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>School </b>transmutation; <b>Level </b>bard 2, magus 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, summoner 2</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Duration</b> 1 round/level</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Saving Throw </b>Will negates; <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Target Restrictions </b><i>selected</i></p>
				<p>The target of a wordspell with this effect word is staggered for this effect word's duration. The target is allowed a new saving throw against this effect word at the end of each of its turns; a successful save ends the duration of this effect word. </p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Boost</b>: The target of a wordspell with this effect word does not receive any additional saving throws to end the effect. If the target fails the first saving throw, it is staggered for the entire duration.</p>

				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>School </b>divination; <b>Level </b>cleric 2, witch 2</p>

				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Saving Throw </b>none; <b>Spell Resistance </b>no</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Target Restrictions </b><i>personal</i></p>
				<p>The target of a wordspell with this effect word can look into the future of one particular action that will happen within the next hour and determine whether or not it is likely to have good or bad results. This prediction is not guaranteed; there is only a 70% chance of receiving an accurate prediction + 1% per caster level. If this check fails, the results are incorrect. The only information the target receives is “weal” for a good outcome, “woe” for a bad outcome, or both for outcomes that are both good and bad, or that are or neutral in regard to the caster. Additional castings concerning the same course of action always reveal the same results.</p>
				<p id="borrow-future-(time)" class="stat-block-title">Borrow Future (Time)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>School </b>transmutation; <b>Level </b>alchemist 4, bard 4, magus 4, sorcerer/wizard 4, summoner 4</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Duration</b> instantaneous</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Saving Throw </b>Will negates (harmless); <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes (harmless)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Target Restrictions </b><i>selected</i></p>
				<p>The target of a wordspell with this effect word takes either a standard action and a move action or a full-round action immediately after a wordspell with this effect word is cast. The target skips its next turn, but any effects that would occur on its turn or spell effects that would expire on its turn occur normally. The target is not helpless on its next turn, but can take no actions.</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Boost</b>: Instead of losing its next turn, the target of a wordspell with this effect word is staggered on its next turn.</p>
				<p id="control-time-(time)" class="stat-block-title">Control Time (Time)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>School </b>transmutation; <b>Level </b>sorcerer/wizard 9</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Duration</b> instantaneous</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Saving Throw </b>Will negates (harmless); <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes (harmless)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Target Restrictions </b><i>selected</i></p>
				<p>Time around the target of a wordspell with this effect word comes to a halt, allowing the target to take 1d4 standard actions before time resumes. All other creatures and objects are immune to the target during these additional actions. Other creatures cannot even be targeted while time is stopped in this way. The target can cast spells and use items on his person at the time of the casting as normal.</p>

				<h2 id="gravity-words">Gravity Words</h2>
				<p>Words from the gravity family use an unseen force to manipulate objects and creatures.</p>
				<p id="lift-(gravity)" class="stat-block-title">Lift (Gravity)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>School </b>transmutation; <b>Level </b>bard 0, magus 0, sorcerer/wizard 0, summoner 0</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Duration</b> concentration</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Saving Throw </b>none; <b>Spell Resistance </b>no</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Target Restrictions </b><i>personal</i></p>
				<p>This effect word grants the caster the ability to lift and move nonmagical objects weighing up to 5 pounds at a distance of up to 25 feet + 5 feet per two levels of the caster. Objects moved by this effect can be moved up to 15 feet per round and cannot be used to make attacks.</p>
				<p id="unfetter-(gravity)" class="stat-block-title">Unfetter (Gravity)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>School </b>transmutation; <b>Level </b>druid 7, sorcerer/wizard 6</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Duration</b> 1 round/level (D)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Saving Throw </b>Will negates; <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Target Restrictions </b><i>selected</i></p>
				<p>This effect word makes the bonds of gravity work in reverse for the targets, causing them to fall up for the duration. They treat up as down and down as up. This can cause the creatures to take falling damage when they hit the ceiling or another surface above them. This effect applies to the targets and all of their gear, so long as it remains on their person. Thrown and missile weapons interact with gravity normally, but the disorientation caused by unfetter means the target takes a &ndash;4 penalty on such attacks. When a wordspell with this effect word ends, the targets fall to the ground unless they have some means of staying aloft.</p>
				<p id="repulse-(gravity)" class="stat-block-title">Repulse (Gravity)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>School </b>transmutation; <b>Level </b>cleric 9, druid 9, sorcerer/wizard 8, summoner 6, witch 8</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Duration</b> 1 round/level (D)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Saving Throw </b>none; <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Target Restrictions </b><i>burst</i> (emanation)</p>
				<p>This effect word creates an area of impossible gravity, where all creatures and objects not securely fastened to the ground fall away from the center of the burst, to its exterior edge. Creatures inside the area when it forms are immediately moved toward its nearest edge. If, because of an obstacle, they cannot reach the edge, they strike the barrier and take falling damage. While a wordspell with this effect word persists, objects cannot enter the area unless they possess the ability to fly. Any flying creatures that rely on wings and enter the area must immediately make a DC 25 <a href="../../../skills/fly.html#fly" >Fly</a> skill check or be repelled by the area, unable to enter this turn. Missile weapons that pass through this area automatically miss their target. The caster is immune to this effect and may enter the area freely.</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Boost</b>: The caster may designate a number of creatures equal to his level that are not affected by the wordspell.</p>

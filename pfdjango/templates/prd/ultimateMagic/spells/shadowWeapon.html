				<p>Drawing upon the Plane of Shadow, you shape a quasi-real masterwork melee weapon of a type you are proficient with. You may use this weapon to make attacks as if it were a real weapon, dealing normal damage for a weapon of its type. The first time you hit a creature with the weapon, it may make a Will save to disbelieve; failure means the weapon deals damage normally, success means it only takes 1 point of damage from the weapon's attacks. The weapon only deals 1 point of damage to objects.</p>
				<p>If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the <i>shadow weapon</i> strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the target may save to disbelieve as normal.</p>
				<p>At 5th level, the weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus. At 10th-level, you may increase the enhancement bonus to +2 or add the <i><a href="../../magicItems/weapons.html#weapons-frost" >frost</a></i> or <i><a href="../../magicItems/weapons.html#weapons-keen" >keen</a></i> weapon property. The frost and keen properties have no effect if the target makes its disbelief save.</p>
				<p>The spell ends if the weapon leaves your possession.</p>

				<p>You create a shelter of slightly sticky webbing. The shelter has a hinged door large enough to accommodate a Medium creature. The opaque walls of the shelter measure 1 inch thick and provide total cover to anyone within it.</p>
				<p>Only Fine creatures with negligible Strength can be caught in the webbing (including swarms); all other creatures can pull themselves free without making a Strength check or taking an action. The webbing is sticky enough to hold twigs, leaves, dirt, and other light items, allowing you to conceal the shelter. The shelter is watertight and insulated when the door is closed. Its surface has a hardness of 0 and 2 hit points for every 5-foot square of web surface area. It takes normal damage from fire and burns as easily as wood. When the spell ends, the webbing decays rapidly and disappears.</p>

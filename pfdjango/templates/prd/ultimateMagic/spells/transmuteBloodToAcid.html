	<p class="stat-block-1"><b>School</b> transmutation [acid, pain]; <b>Level</b> sorcerer/wizard 9</p>
	<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Casting Time</b> 1 standard action</p>
	<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Components</b> V, S, M (a wax doll and a vial of acid worth 10 gp)</p>
	<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Range</b> close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>
	<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Target</b> one living creature</p>
	<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Duration</b> concentration (maximum 1 round/5 levels)</p>
	<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Saving Throw</b> Fortitude half; <b>Spell Resistance</b> yes</p>
				<p>You transmute blood in the target's body to acid, dealing 1d6 points of acid damage/2 levels (maximum 12d6) each round. The creature is staggered and sickened by the debilitating pain. A successful Fortitude save each round halves the damage and negates the staggered condition for 1 round. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 or fewer hit points, it dissolves, leaving only the barest trace of remains. A dissolved creature's equipment is unaffected.</p>
				<p>Anyone who strikes the target with a non-reach melee weapon, natural weapon, or unarmed attack takes 3d6 points of acid damage as the acidic blood sprays on the attacker. If the attack is from a piercing or slashing manufactured weapon, the weapon also takes this damage.</p>
				<p>This spell has no effect on creatures immune to critical hits or bleed effects.</p>

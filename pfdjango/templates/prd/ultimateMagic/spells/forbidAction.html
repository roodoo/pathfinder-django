				<p>You forbid the target a single course of action, which it avoids to the best of its ability. You may demand the target not take actions that fall into one of the following options.</p>
				<p id="attack"><i>Attack</i>: The target cannot take any action that involves an attack roll, or uses a spell or ability that targets a foe or an area that includes a foe.</p>
				<p id="cast"><i>Cast</i>: Target cannot cast spells or use spell-like abilities.</p>
				<p id="communicate"><i>Communicate</i>: The target cannot take any actions that allow it to communicate with anyone. This includes such acts as speaking, <a href="../../skills/bluff.html#bluff" >Bluff</a> checks to pass secret messages, writing, and using telepathy. It does not prevent verbalizations made for purposes other than communication, such as command words or the verbal component of spellcasting.</p>
				<p id="draw"><i>Draw</i>: Target cannot ready or prepare any item, weapon, component, or equipment.</p>
				<p id="move"><i>Move</i>: The target can take no act that would cause it to end up in a different location. The target does not resist being moved by others (and thus can be picked up or dragged, or can float along on a raft), but does not consciously attempt to move (including not directing a mount to move).</p>
				<p>The target is free to take any actions not forbidden by the caster. For example, a target affected by this spell's demand to not move is still free to cast spells, make attacks, or shout for help.</p>

	<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Duration</b> 1 round/level</p>
				<p>This spell functions as <i>forbid action</i>, except up to one creature per level may be affected. Each creature must receive the same forbidden action.</p>

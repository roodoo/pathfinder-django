				<p>This spell functions as <i><a href="../../spells/symbolOfDeath.html#symbol-of-death" >symbol of death</a></i>, except it instead creates one illusory duplicate of each creature within 60 feet of the symbol. These duplicates function as <i><a href="../../spells/mirrorImage.html#mirror-image" >mirror image</a></i>, moving with the original creatures and mimicking their movements, sounds, and actions exactly. If an illusory double is destroyed, a new one appears on the creature's turn. The images last for as long as a creature remains within 60 feet of the symbol, and for 1 round/level thereafter. Once triggered, the symbol remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.</p>
				<p><i>Symbol of mirroring</i> can be made permanent with a <i><a href="../../spells/permanency.html#permanency" >permanency</a></i> spell by a caster of 10th level or higher for the cost of 5,000 gp.</p>

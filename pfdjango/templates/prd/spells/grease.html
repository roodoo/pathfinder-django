				<p>A <i>grease </i>spell covers a solid surface with a layer of slippery grease. Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must make a successful <a href="../combat.html#reflex" >Reflex</a> save or fall. A creature can walk within or through the area of grease at half normal speed with a DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure means it can't move that round (and must then make a <a href="../combat.html#reflex" >Reflex</a> save or fall), while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Acrobatics skill for details). Creatures that do not move on their turn do not need to make this check and are not considered <a href="../glossary.html#flat-footed" >flat-footed</a>.</p>
				<p>The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item. Material objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while an object wielded or employed by a creature requires its bearer to make a <a href="../combat.html#reflex" >Reflex</a> saving throw to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw fails, the creature immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made in each round that the creature attempts to pick up or use the <i>greased </i>item. A creature wearing <i>greased </i>armor or clothing gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks and combat maneuver checks made to escape a grapple, and to their <a href="../combat.html#combat-maneuver-defense" >CMD</a> to avoid being <a href="../glossary.html#grappled" >grappled</a>.</p>

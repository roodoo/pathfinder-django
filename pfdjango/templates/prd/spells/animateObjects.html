				<p>You imbue inanimate objects with mobility and a semblance of life. Each such animated object then immediately attacks whomever or whatever you initially designate.</p>
				<p>An animated object can be of any nonmagical material. You may animate one Small or smaller object or a corresponding number of larger objects as follows: A Medium object counts as two Small or smaller objects, a Large object as four, a Huge object as eight, a Gargantuan object as 16, and a Colossal object as 32. You can change the designated target or targets as a move action, as if directing an active spell.</p>
				<p>This spell cannot affect objects carried or worn by a creature.</p>
				<p><i>Animate objects </i>can be made permanent with a <i><a href="permanency.html#permanency" >permanency</a> </i>spell.</p>

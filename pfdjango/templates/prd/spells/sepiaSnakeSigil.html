				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>School</b> conjuration (creation) [force]; <b>Level</b> bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Casting Time</b> 10 minutes</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Components</b> V, S, M (powdered amber worth 500 gp and a snake scale)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Range</b> touch</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Target</b> one touched book or written work</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Duration</b> permanent or until discharged; until released or 1d4 days + 1 day/level; see text</p>

				<p>You cause a small symbol to appear in the text of a written work. The text containing the symbol must be at least 25 words long. When anyone reads the text containing the symbol, the <i>sepia snake sigil </i>springs into being, transforming into a large sepia serpent that strikes at the reader, provided there is line of effect between the symbol and the reader.</p>
				<p>Simply seeing the enspelled text is not sufficient to trigger the spell; the subject must deliberately read it. The target is entitled to a save to evade the snake's strike. If it succeeds, the <i>sepia snake </i>dissipates in a flash of brown light accompanied by a puff of dun-colored smoke and a loud noise. If the target fails its save, it is engulfed in a shimmering amber field of force and immobilized until released, either at your command or when 1d4 days + 1 day per caster level have elapsed.</p>
				<p>While trapped in the amber field of force, the subject does not age, breathe, grow hungry, sleep, or regain spells. It is preserved in a state of suspended animation, unaware of its surroundings. It can be damaged by outside forces (and perhaps even killed), since the field provides no protection against physical injury. However, a <a href="../glossary.html#dying" >dying</a> subject does not lose hit points or become <a href="../glossary.html#stable" >stable</a> until the spell ends.</p>
				<p>The hidden sigil cannot be detected by normal observation, and <i><a href="detectMagic.html#detect-magic" >detect magic</a> </i>reveals only that the entire text is magical.</p>
				<p>A <i><a href="dispelMagic.html#dispel-magic" >dispel magic</a> </i>can remove the sigil. An <i>erase </i>spell destroys the entire page of text.</p>
				<p><i>Sepia snake sigil </i>can be cast in combination with other spells that hide or garble text, such as <i><a href="secretPage.html#secret-page" >secret page</a>.</i></p>

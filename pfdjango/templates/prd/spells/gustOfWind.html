				<p>This spell creates a severe blast of air (approximately 50 mph) that originates from you, affecting all creatures in its path. All flying creatures in this area take a &ndash;4 penalty on Fly skill checks. Tiny or smaller flying creatures must make a DC 25 Fly skill check or be blown back 2d6 &times; 10 feet and take 2d6 points of damage. Small or smaller flying creatures must make a DC 20 Fly skill check to move against the force of the wind.</p>
				<p>A Tiny or smaller creature on the ground is knocked down and rolled 1d4 &times; 10 feet, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet.</p>
				<p>Small creatures are knocked <a href="../glossary.html#prone" >prone</a> by the force of the wind.</p>
				<p>Medium or smaller creatures are unable to move forward against the force of the wind unless they succeed at a DC 15 <a href="../gettingStarted.html#strength" >Strength</a> check.</p>
				<p>Large or larger creatures may move normally within a <i>gust of wind </i>effect.</p>
				<p>This spell can't move a creature beyond the limit of it's range.</p>
				<p>Any creature, regardless of size, takes a &ndash;4 penalty on ranged attacks and Perception checks in the area of a <i>gust of wind</i>.</p>
				<p>The force of the gust automatically extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. It causes protected flames, such as those in lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50% chance to extinguish those lights.</p>
				<p>In addition to the effects noted, a <i>gust of wind </i>can do anything that a sudden blast of wind would be expected to do. It can create a stinging spray of sand or dust, fan a large fire, overturn delicate awnings or hangings, heel over a small boat, and blow gases or vapors to the edge of its range.</p>
				<p><i>Gust of wind </i>can be made permanent with a <i><a href="permanency.html#permanency" >permanency</a> </i>spell.</p>

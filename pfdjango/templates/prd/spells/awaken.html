				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>School </b>transmutation; <b>Level </b>druid 5</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Casting Time </b>24 hours</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Components </b>V, S, M (herbs and oils worth 2,000 gp), DF</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Range </b>touch</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Target</b> animal or tree touched</p>

				<p>You awaken a tree or animal to human-like sentience. To succeed, you must make a <a href="../combat.html#will" >Will</a> save (DC 10 + the animal's current HD, or the HD the tree will have once awakened). The awakened animal or tree is friendly toward you. You have no special empathy or connection with a creature you awaken, although it serves you in specific tasks or endeavors if you communicate your desires to it. If you cast <i>awaken</i> again, any previously awakened creatures remain friendly to you, but they no longer undertake tasks for you unless it is in their best interests.</p>
				<p>An awakened tree has characteristics as if it were an animated object, except that it gains the plant type and its <a href="../gettingStarted.html#intelligence" >Intelligence</a>, <a href="../gettingStarted.html#wisdom" >Wisdom</a>, and <a href="../gettingStarted.html#charisma-new" >Charisma</a> scores are each 3d6. An awakened plant gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it has senses similar to a human's.</p>
				<p>An awakened animal gets 3d6 <a href="../gettingStarted.html#intelligence" >Intelligence</a>, +1d3 <a href="../gettingStarted.html#charisma-new" >Charisma</a>, and +2 HD. Its type becomes magical beast (augmented animal). An awakened animal can't serve as an animal companion, familiar, or special mount. </p>
				<p>An awakened tree or animal can speak one language that you know, plus one additional language that you know per point of <a href="../gettingStarted.html#intelligence" >Intelligence</a> bonus (if any). This spell does not function on an animal or plant with an <a href="../gettingStarted.html#intelligence" >Intelligence</a> greater than 2.</p>

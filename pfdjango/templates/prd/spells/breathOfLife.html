				<p>This spell cures 5d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +25). </p>
				<p>Unlike other spells that heal damage, <i>breath of life</i> can bring recently slain creatures back to life. If cast upon a creature that has died within 1 round, apply the healing from this spell to the creature. If the healed creature's hit point total is at a negative amount less than its <a href="../gettingStarted.html#constitution" >Constitution</a> score, it comes back to life and stabilizes at its new hit point total. If the creature's hit point total is at a negative amount equal to or greater than its <a href="../gettingStarted.html#constitution" >Constitution</a> score, the creature remains dead. Creatures brought back to life through <i>breath of life</i> gain a temporary <a href="../glossary.html#energy-drain-and-negative-levels" >negative level </a>that lasts for 1 day.</p>
				<p>Creatures slain by death effects cannot be saved by <i>breath of life</i>.</p>
				<p>Like cure spells, <i>breath of life</i> deals damage to undead creatures rather than curing them, and cannot bring them back to life.</p>

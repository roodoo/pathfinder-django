				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Casting Time</b> 1 standard action</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Components</b> V, S, M (a piece of mirror and a miniature brass hearing trumpet)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Range</b> 40 ft.</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Area</b> 40-ft.-radius emanation centered on you</p>

				<p>You immediately become aware of any attempt to observe you by means of a divination (scrying) spell or effect. The spell's area radiates from you and moves as you move. You know the location of every magical sensor within the spell's area.</p>
				<p>If the scrying attempt originates within the area, you also know its location; otherwise, you and the scrier immediately make opposed caster level checks (1d20 + caster level). If you at least match the scrier's result, you get a visual image of the scrier and an accurate sense of his direction and distance from you.</p>

				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>School</b> enchantment (compulsion) [language-dependent, mind-affecting]; <b>Level</b> bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 3</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Casting Time</b> 1 standard action</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Components</b> V, M (a snake's tongue and a honeycomb)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Range</b> close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Target</b> one living creature</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Duration</b> 1 hour/level or until completed</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Saving Throw </b><a href="../combat.html#will" >Will</a> negates; <b><a href="../glossary.html#spell-resistance" >Spell Resistance</a></b> yes</p>
				<p>You influence the actions of the target creature by suggesting a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two). The <i>suggestion </i>must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable. Asking the creature to do some obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell. </p>
				<p>The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. You can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. If the condition is not met before the spell duration expires, the activity is not performed.</p>
				<p>A very reasonable <i>suggestion </i>causes the save to be made with a penalty (such as &ndash;1 or &ndash;2).</p>

				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>School</b> enchantment (compulsion) [language-dependent, mind-affecting]; <b>Level</b> bard 5, sorcerer/wizard 6</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Range </b>medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Targets</b> one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart</p>
				<p>This spell functions like <i><a href="#suggestion" >suggestion</a></i>, except that it can affect more creatures. The same <i><a href="#suggestion" >suggestion</a> </i>applies to all these creatures.</p>

				<p>This spell grants you a sixth sense. Once during the spell's duration, you may choose to use its effect. This spell grants you an insight bonus equal to your caster level (maximum +25) on any single attack roll, combat maneuver check, opposed ability or skill check, or saving throw. Alternatively, you can apply the insight bonus to your <a href="../combat.html#armor-class" >AC</a> against a single attack (even if <a href="../glossary.html#flat-footed" >flat-footed</a>). Activating the effect doesn't take an action; you can even activate it on another character's turn. You must choose to use the <i>moment of prescience </i>before you make the roll it is to modify. Once used, the spell ends. You can't have more than one <i>moment of prescience </i>active on you at the same time.</p>

				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>School</b> conjuration (creation); <b>Level</b> sorcerer/wizard 7</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Casting Time</b> 1 standard action</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Components</b> V, S, F (a miniature ivory door, a piece of polished marble, and a silver spoon, each worth 5 gp)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Range</b> close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Effect</b> extradimensional mansion, up to three 10-ft. cubes/level (S)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Duration</b> 2 hours/level (D)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Saving Throw</b> none; <b><a href="../glossary.html#spell-resistance" >Spell Resistance</a></b> no</p>
				<p>You conjure up an extradimensional dwelling that has a single entrance on the plane from which the spell was cast. The entry point looks like a faint shimmering in the air that is 4 feet wide and 8 feet high. Only those you designate may enter the mansion, and the portal is shut and made <a href="../glossary.html#invisible" >invisible</a> behind you when you enter. You may open it again from your own side at will. Once observers have passed beyond the entrance, they are in a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.</p>
				<p>You can create any floor plan you desire to the limit of the spell's effect. The place is furnished and contains sufficient foodstuffs to serve a nine-course banquet to a dozen people per caster level. A staff of near-transparent servants (as many as two per caster level), liveried and obedient, wait upon all who enter. The servants function as <i>unseen servant </i>spells except that they are visible and can go anywhere in the mansion.</p>
				<p>Since the place can be entered only through its special portal, outside conditions do not affect the mansion, nor do conditions inside it pass to the plane beyond.</p>

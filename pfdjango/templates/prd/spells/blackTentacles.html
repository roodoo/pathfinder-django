				<p>This spell causes a field of rubbery black tentacles to appear, burrowing up from the floor and reaching for any creature in the area. </p>
				<p>Every creature within the area of the spell is the target of a combat maneuver check made to grapple each round at the beginning of your turn, including the round that <i>black tentacles</i> is cast. Creatures that enter the area of effect are also automatically attacked. The tentacles do not provoke attacks of opportunity. When determining the tentacles' <a href="../combat.html#combat-maneuver-bonus" >CMB</a>, the tentacles use your caster level as their base attack bonus and receive a +4 bonus due to their <a href="../gettingStarted.html#strength" >Strength</a> and a +1 size bonus. Roll only once for the entire spell effect each round and apply the result to all creatures in the area of effect.</p>
				<p>If the tentacles succeed in grappling a foe, that foe takes 1d6+4 points of damage and gains the <a href="../glossary.html#grappled" >grappled</a> condition. Grappled opponents cannot move without first breaking the grapple. All other movement is prohibited unless the creature breaks the grapple first. The <i>black tentacles</i> spell receives a +5 bonus on grapple checks made against opponents it is already grappling, but cannot move foes or pin foes. Each round that <i>black tentacles</i> succeeds on a grapple check, it deals an additional 1d6+4 points of damage. The <a href="../combat.html#combat-maneuver-defense" >CMD</a> of <i>black tentacles</i>, for the purposes of escaping the grapple, is equal to 10 + its <a href="../combat.html#combat-maneuver-bonus" >CMB</a>.</p>
				<p>The tentacles created by this spell cannot be damaged, but they can be dispelled as normal. The entire area of effect is considered difficult terrain while the tentacles last.</p>

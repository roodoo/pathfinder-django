				<p>This spell functions as <i><a href="interposingHand.html#interposing-hand" >interposing hand</a></i>, except that it can also grapple one opponent you select. The <i>grasping hand</i> gets one grapple attack per round. This attack does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Its <a href="../combat.html#combat-maneuver-bonus" >CMB</a> and <a href="../combat.html#combat-maneuver-defense" >CMD</a> for grapple checks use your caster level in place of its base attack bonus, with a +10 bonus for its <a href="../gettingStarted.html#strength" >Strength</a> (31) score and a +1 bonus for being Large (its <a href="../gettingStarted.html#dexterity" >Dexterity</a> is 10, granting no bonus on the <a href="../combat.html#combat-maneuver-defense" >Combat Maneuver Defense</a>). The hand holds but does not harm creatures that it grapples. Directing the spell to a new target is a move action. The <i>grasping hand</i> can instead be directed to bull rush a target, using the same bonuses outlined above, or it can be directed to interpose itself, as <i><a href="interposingHand.html#interposing-hand" >interposing hand</a></i> does.</p>

				<p>The food that this spell creates is simple fare of your choice&mdash;highly nourishing, if rather bland. Food so created decays and becomes inedible after 24 hours, although it can be kept fresh for another 24 hours by casting a <i>purify food and water </i>spell on it. The water created by this spell is just like clean rain water, and it doesn't go bad as the food does.</p>

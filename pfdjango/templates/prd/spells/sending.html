				<p>You contact a particular creature with which you are familiar and send a short message of 25 words or less to the subject. The subject recognizes you if it knows you. It can answer in like manner immediately. A creature with an <a href="../gettingStarted.html#intelligence" >Intelligence</a> score as low as 1 can understand the <i>sending, </i>though the subject's ability to react is limited as normal by its <a href="../gettingStarted.html#intelligence" >Intelligence</a>. Even if the <i>sending </i>is received, the subject is not obligated to act upon it in any manner.</p>
				<p>If the creature in question is not on the same plane of existence as you are, there is a 5% chance that the <i>sending </i>does not arrive. (Local conditions on other planes may worsen this chance considerably.)</p>

				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>School</b> transmutation; <b>Level</b> druid 2</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Casting Time</b> 1 standard action</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Components</b> V, S</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Range</b> close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Target</b> 1 Small wooden object/level, all within a 20-ft. radius</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Duration</b> instantaneous</p>

				<p>You cause wood to bend and warp, permanently destroying its straightness, form, and strength. A warped door springs open (or becomes stuck, requiring a <a href="../gettingStarted.html#strength" >Strength</a> check to open, at your option). A boat or ship springs a leak. Warped ranged weapons are useless. A warped melee weapon causes a &ndash;4 penalty on attack rolls.</p>
				<p>You may warp one Small or smaller object or its equivalent per caster level. A Medium object counts as two Small objects, a Large object as four, a Huge object as eight, a Gargantuan object as 16, and a Colossal object as 32.</p>
				<p>Alternatively, you can unwarp wood (effectively warping it back to normal) with this spell. <i><a href="makeWhole.html#make-whole" >Make whole</a></i>, on the other hand, does no good in repairing a warped item.</p>
				<p>You can combine multiple consecutive <i>warp wood </i>spells to warp (or unwarp) an object that is too large for you to warp with a single spell. Until the object is completely warped, it suffers no ill effects.</p>

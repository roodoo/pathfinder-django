				<p>You tap energy from the Plane of Shadow to cast a quasi-real, illusory version of a sorcerer or wizard evocation spell of 4th level or lower. Spells that deal damage have normal effects unless an affected creature succeeds on a <a href="../combat.html#will" >Will</a> save. Each disbelieving creature takes only one-fifth damage from the attack. If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is one-fifth as strong (if applicable) or only 20% likely to occur. If recognized as a <i>shadow evocation, </i>a damaging spell deals only one-fifth (20%) damage. Regardless of the result of the save to disbelieve, an affected creature is also allowed any save (or <a href="../glossary.html#spell-resistance" >spell resistance</a>) that the spell being simulated allows, but the save DC is set according to <i>shadow evocation'</i>s level (5th) rather than the spell's normal level.</p>
				<p>Nondamaging effects have normal effects except against those who disbelieve them. Against disbelievers, they have no effect.</p>
				<p>Objects automatically succeed on their <a href="../combat.html#will" >Will</a> saves against this spell.</p>
				<p id="shadow-evocation-greater" class="stat-block-title"><b>Shadow Evocation, Greater</b></p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>School</b> illusion (shadow); <b>Level</b> sorcerer/wizard 8</p>
				<p>This spell functions like <i><a href="#shadow-evocation" >shadow evocation</a>, </i>except that it enables you to create partially real, illusory versions of sorcerer or wizard evocation spells of 7th level or lower. If recognized as a <i>greater shadow evocation</i>, a damaging spell deals only three-fifths (60%) damage.</p>

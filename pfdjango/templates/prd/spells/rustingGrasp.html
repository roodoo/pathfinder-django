				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Components</b> V, S, DF</p>

				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Target</b> one nonmagical ferrous object (or the volume of the object within 3 ft. of the touched point) or one ferrous creature</p>

				<p>Any iron or iron alloy item you touch crumbles into rust. If the item is so large that it cannot fit within a 3-foot radius, a 3-foot-radius volume of the metal is rusted and destroyed. Magic items made of metal are immune to this spell.</p>
				<p>You may employ <i>rusting grasp </i>in combat with a successful melee touch attack. <i>Rusting grasp </i>used in this way instantaneously destroys 1d6 points of <a href="../combat.html#armor-class" >AC</a> gained from metal armor (to the maximum amount of protection the armor offers) through corrosion. </p>
				<p>Weapons in use by an opponent targeted by the spell are more difficult to grasp. You must succeed on a melee touch attack against the weapon. A metal weapon that is hit is destroyed. Striking at an opponent's weapon provokes an attack of opportunity. Also, you must touch the weapon and not the other way around.</p>
				<p>Against a ferrous creature, <i>rusting grasp </i>instantaneously deals 3d6 points of damage + 1 per caster level (maximum +15) per successful attack. The spell lasts for 1 round per level, and you can make one melee touch attack per round.</p>

				<p>This spell makes a weapon magically keen, improving its ability to deal telling blows. This transmutation doubles the threat range of the weapon. A threat range of 20 becomes 19&ndash;20, a threat range of 19&ndash;20 becomes 17&ndash;20, and a threat range of 18&ndash;20 becomes 15&ndash;20. The spell can be cast only on piercing or slashing weapons. If cast on arrows or crossbow bolts, the <i>keen edge </i>on a particular projectile ends after one use, whether or not the missile strikes its intended target. Treat shuriken as arrows, rather than as thrown weapons, for the purpose of this spell.</p>
				<p>Multiple effects that increase a weapon's threat range (such as the <i>keen </i>special weapon property and the Improved Critical feat) don't stack. You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as a claw.</p>

				<p>This spell causes tall grass, weeds, and other plants to wrap around creatures in the area of effect or those that enter the area. Creatures that fail their save gain the <a href="../glossary.html#entangled" >entangled</a> condition. Creatures that make their save can move as normal, but those that remain in the area must save again at the end of your turn. Creatures that move into the area must save immediately. Those that fail must end their movement and gain the <a href="../glossary.html#entangled" >entangled</a> condition. <a href="../glossary.html#entangled" >Entangled</a> creatures can attempt to break free as a move action, making a <a href="../gettingStarted.html#strength" >Strength</a> or Escape Artist check. The DC for this check is equal to the DC of the spell. The entire area of effect is considered difficult terrain while the effect lasts.</p>
				<p>If the plants in the area are covered in thorns, those in the area take 1 point of damage each time they fail a save against the <i>entangle</i> or fail a check made to break free. Other effects, depending on the local plants, might be possible at GM discretion.</p>

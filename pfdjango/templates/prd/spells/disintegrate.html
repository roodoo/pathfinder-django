				<p>A thin, green ray springs from your pointing finger. You must make a successful ranged touch attack to hit. Any creature struck by the ray takes 2d6 points of damage per caster level (to a maximum of 40d6). Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by this spell is entirely disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. A disintegrated creature's equipment is unaffected.</p>
				<p>When used against an object, the ray simply disintegrates as much as a 10-foot cube of nonliving matter. Thus, the spell disintegrates only part of any very large object or structure targeted. The ray affects even objects constructed entirely of force, such as <i><a href="forcefulHand.html#forceful-hand" >forceful hand</a> </i>or a <i><a href="wallOfForce.html#wall-of-force" >wall of force</a></i>, but not magical effects such as a <i><a href="globeOfInvulnerability.html#globe-of-invulnerability" >globe of invulnerability</a> </i>or an <i><a href="antimagicField.html#antimagic-field" >antimagic field</a>.</i></p>
				<p>A creature or object that makes a successful <a href="../combat.html#fortitude" >Fortitude</a> save is partially affected, taking only 5d6 points of damage. If this damage reduces the creature or object to 0 or fewer hit points, it is entirely disintegrated.</p>
				<p>Only the first creature or object struck can be affected; that is, the ray affects only one target per casting.</p>

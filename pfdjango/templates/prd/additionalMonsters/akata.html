				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Deaf (Ex)</b> Akatas cannot hear. They are immune to spells and effects that rely on hearing to function, but they also cannot make <a href="../skills/perception.html#perception" >Perception</a> checks to listen.</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Hibernation (Ex)</b> Akatas can enter a state of hibernation for an indefinite period of time when food is scarce. When an akata wishes to enter hibernation, it seeks out a den and surrounds itself in a layer of fibrous material excreted from its mouth&mdash;these fibers quickly harden into a dense, almost metallic cocoon. While hibernating, an akata does not need to drink or eat. The cocoon has hardness 10 and 60 hit points, and is immune to <a href="creatureTypes.html#fire-subtype" >fire</a> and bludgeoning (including falling) damage. As long as the cocoon remains intact, the akata within remains unharmed. The akata remains in a state of hibernation until it senses another living creature within 10 feet or is exposed to extreme <a href="universalMonsterRules.html#heat" >heat</a>, at which point it claws its way to freedom in 1d4 minutes as its cocoon degrades to fragments of strange metal.</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Salt Water Vulnerability (Ex)</b> Salt water acts as an extremely strong acid to akatas. A splash of salt water deals 1d6 points of damage to an akata, and full immersion in salt water deals 4d6 points of damage per round.</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Void Bite (Ex)</b> Akatas hold hundreds of invisibly small larval young within their mouths, spreading these parasitic creatures to hosts through their bite. Only humanoids make suitable hosts for akata young&mdash;all other creature types are immune to this parasitic infection. The <a href="universalMonsterRules.html#disease-(ex-or-su)" >disease</a> itself is known as void death. </p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b><a href="universalMonsterRules.html#disease-(ex-or-su)" >Disease</a> (Ex)</b> <i>Void Death</i>: Bite&mdash;injury; <i>save</i> Fort DC 12; <i>onset</i> 1 hour; <i>frequency</i> 1/day; <i>effect</i> 1d2 Dex and 1d2 Con damage; an infected creature who dies rises as a void zombie 2d4 hours later (see below); <i>cure</i> 2 consecutive saves.</p>
				
				<p>Akatas hail from a strange, distant planet that long ago succumbed to a cataclysmic end. Countless akatas clung to fragments of the dead planet, entering hibernation and riding these asteroids until they eventually crashed upon a new planet&mdash;akatas' cocoons protected them from the impact, and they soon awoke to seek out suitable hosts to spawn their young. Left untended, an akata scourge can quickly grow into a significant threat. A typical akata stands 3-1/2 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds.</p>
				<h2 id="void-zombie">Void Zombie (CR +1)</h2>
				<p>A humanoid killed by void death becomes a void zombie. A void zombie is a fast zombie (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary </i>page 289) that gains a secondary “tongue” attack (actually the larval akata's feeding tendril), dealing 1d6 points of damage. A void zombie also gains the following special attack.</p>
				<p id="blood-drain"><b>Blood Drain (Ex)</b> If a void zombie hits a living creature with its tongue attack, it drains blood, dealing 2 points of Strength damage before the tongue detaches.</p>

				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Frightener (Su)</b> Once per minute as a standard action, a poltergeist can temporarily drop its <a href="universalMonsterRules.html#natural-invisibility-(ex-or-su)" >natural invisibility</a>, revealing itself to be a skeletal, ghost-like <a href="creatureTypes.html#humanoid" >humanoid</a>. All creatures within 30 feet when a poltergeist uses this ability must make a DC 14 Will save to avoid becoming frightened for 1d4 rounds. The poltergeist then resumes its invisibility at the end of its turn as a free action. A creature that successfully saves is immune to the <a href="universalMonsterRules.html#fear-(su-or-sp)" >fear</a> effect of that poltergeist for 24 hours. If the poltergeist's <a href="universalMonsterRules.html#natural-invisibility-(ex-or-su)" >natural invisibility</a> is negated via other methods, it cannot use this ability. Likewise, those that can see invisible creatures are immune to this special attack. This is a mind-affecting <a href="universalMonsterRules.html#fear-(su-or-sp)" >fear</a> effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Rejuvenation (Su)</b> When a poltergeist is destroyed, it only remains destroyed for 2d4 days. After this time, the <a href="creatureTypes.html#undead" >undead</a> spirit reforms where it was destroyed, fully healed. The only way to permanently destroy a poltergeist is to determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from resting in peace. The exact means varies with each spirit and may require a <a href="creatureTypes.html#good-subtype" >good</a> deal of research, and should be created specifically for each different poltergeist or group of poltergeists by the GM.</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Site Bound (Ex)</b> A poltergeist cannot travel more than 120 feet from the point at which it was created or formed.</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Telekinesis (Su)</b> A poltergeist has no method of attacking apart from telekinesis. This ability functions as the spell <i><a href="../spells/telekinesis.html#telekinesis" >telekinesis</a></i>, with a CL equal to the poltergeist's Hit Dice (CL 3rd for most poltergeists). A typical poltergeist has a ranged attack roll of +3 when using telekinesis to hurl objects or creatures, and can use the ability on objects or creatures of up to 75 pounds. If a poltergeist attempts to hurl a creature with this ability, that creature can resist the effect with a successful DC 12 Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>
				
				<p>A poltergeist is an angry spirit that forms from the soul of a creature that, for whatever reason, becomes unable to leave the site of its death. Sometimes, this might be due to an unfinished task&mdash;other times, it might be due to a powerful necromantic effect. Desecrating a grave site by building a structure over the body below is the most common method of accidentally creating a poltergeist. The poltergeist experiences great trauma over its condition; this trauma twists its psyche to evil and fosters an overall hatred of the living expressed in outbursts of rage. A poltergeist is bound to a specific place, usually a building, room, or recognizable area (a section of a cemetery, a stretch of lonely road, and so on). This place typically corresponds to its place of death or the resting place of its mortal remains.</p>

				<p>Ice trolls are somewhat smaller than normal trolls, but they possess greater intelligence and cunning and are just as voraciously hungry. They display the typical hunched posture of trolls, combined with long arms tipped with sharp claws and the distinctive troll underbite. Like normal trolls, ice trolls possess amazing regenerative powers that enable them to recover from almost any wound. Unlike most trolls, ice trolls often use weapons in battle, but in the heat of combat, they often cast aside weapons in favor of their rending claws. An ice troll stands about 10 feet tall and weighs up to 900 pounds.</p>
				<p>Because of their greater intellects, ice trolls sometimes work as mercenaries, and often serve as soldiers in monstrous armies. They frequently ally with frost giants, and may even be found among northern barbarian tribes, as long as they are well fed and well paid.</p>
				<p>Ice trolls enjoy the taste of human flesh, and those not working with humans frequently set traps near civilized areas to catch their favorite prey. They will also raid isolated settlements for food, often bringing captured humans back to their icy lairs, where the unfortunate victims are caged and fattened up before finally being devoured by the voracious trolls.</p>
				<p>In combat, ice trolls are more cautious than normal trolls. They do not normally rush headlong into battle, instead focusing on weaker foes or those bearing fire. They do not hesitate to attack opponents armed with fire, but work together to defeat such enemies before they can bring their dangerous weapons to bear.</p>
				<p>Ice troll society is more patriarchal than normal troll society, and while males may form gangs to hunt or raid, most ice trolls live in small family groups comprised of a male, a female, and their offspring.</p>

				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Sunlight Petrification (Ex)</b> A rock troll that is exposed to natural sunlight is staggered and must make a DC 20 Fortitude save each round to resist permanently turning to stone. A <i><a href="../spells/stoneToFlesh.html#stone-to-flesh" >stone to flesh</a></i> spell (or similar effect) restores a petrified rock troll, but if it remains exposed to sunlight, it must immediately start making new Fortitude saves to avoid petrification. Spells like <i>sunray</i> or <i><a href="../spells/sunburst.html#sunburst" >sunburst</a></i> that create powerful natural sunlight cannot petrify a rock troll, but the troll is staggered for 1d4 rounds after being exposed to such an effect.</p>
				
				<p>Rock trolls are relatives of normal trolls and ice trolls, but make their lairs far beneath the earth in underground caverns. They rarely venture forth from their subterranean lairs, for they have a weakness unknown in other troll subspecies&mdash;the light of the sun turns them to solid stone. Rock trolls have stony skin studded with crystals, but otherwise display typical troll characteristics&mdash;hunched posture, long arms, a large underbite, and powerful regenerative abilities. Because of the crystalline nature of their skin, however, rock trolls prove more susceptible to sonic damage than other trolls, but they are able to regenerate even wounds dealt by fire. Rock trolls are larger and stronger than normal trolls, typically standing 15 to 16 feet tall in height, and weighing upward of 1,200 pounds.</p>
				<p>Rock trolls are fond of humanoid flesh, but eat whatever food they can get their claws on. Most underground creatures go out of their way to avoid rock trolls, as the ravenous creatures will eat anything that passes through their territory, as long as it is at least marginally edible. Rock trolls also occasionally eat rocks and minerals, though such fare seems to do little to soothe their voracious hungers. Instead, these minerals supplement the trolls' diet, strengthening their skin, teeth, and claws. Deposits of certain crystals seem especially tasty to rock trolls, and a rock troll who finds such a collection will often gorge himself on the crystalline delicacies.</p>

				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>School</b> evocation [air, electricity]; <b>Level</b> druid 4, sorcerer/wizard 4</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Casting Time</b> 1 standard action</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Components</b> V, S, M/DF (a small iron ring)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Range</b> medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Effect</b> two or more 5-ft.-diameter spheres</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Duration</b> 1 round/level</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Saving Throw</b> Reflex negates; <b>Spell Resistance</b> yes</p>
				<p>You create two globes of lightning that fly in whichever direction you indicate. For every 4 caster levels above 7th, you create an additional globe of lightning (3 globes at 11th, 4 globes at 15th, to the maximum of 5 globes at 19th). These globes fly at a rate of 20 feet per round and have perfect maneuverability. Wind does not affect a flying sphere's course.</p>
				<p>If a globe enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 3d6 points of electricity damage to that creature, though a successful Reflex save negates the damage. Creatures wearing metal armor take a &ndash;4 penalty on this saving throw.</p>
				<p>Each globe moves as long as you actively direct it (it's a move action for you to direct all the spheres created by a single casting of this spell); otherwise they stay at rest. These globes have no mass and cannot push aside unwilling creatures or move solid objects. A <i><a href="#ball-lightning" >ball lightning</a></i> globe winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.</p>

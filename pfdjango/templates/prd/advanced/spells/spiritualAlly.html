				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>School</b> evocation [force]; <b>Level</b> cleric 4</p>

				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Components</b> V, S, DF</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Range</b> medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Effect</b> spiritual ally of force</p>

				<p>An ally made of pure force appears in a single 5-foot square within range. The ally takes the form of a servant of your god. The <i><a href="#spiritual-ally" >spiritual ally</a></i> occupies its space, though you and your allies can move through it, since it is your ally. The <i><a href="#spiritual-ally" >spiritual ally</a></i> carries a single weapon, one favored by your deity (as for <i><a href="../../spells/spiritualWeapon.html#spiritual-weapon" >spiritual weapon</a></i>), which has the same threat range and critical modifiers as a real weapon of its form. Each round on your turn, starting with the turn that you cast this spell, your <i><a href="#spiritual-ally" >spiritual ally</a></i> can make an attack against a foe within its reach that you designate. The <i><a href="#spiritual-ally" >spiritual ally</a></i> threatens adjacent squares and can flank and make attacks of opportunity as if it were a normal creature. The <i><a href="#spiritual-ally" >spiritual ally</a></i> uses your base attack bonus (gaining extra attacks if your base attack bonus is high enough) plus your Wisdom bonus when it makes a melee attack. When the <i><a href="#spiritual-ally" >spiritual ally</a></i> hits, it deals 1d10 points of force damage + 1 point of damage per 3 caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). It strikes as a spell, not a weapon, so it bypasses DR and can affect incorporeal creatures.</p>
				<p>Each round after the first, you can move the <i><a href="#spiritual-ally" >spiritual ally</a></i> as a swift action. It has a speed of 30 feet, and a fly speed of 30 feet (perfect maneuverability). Being a construct of force, the <i><a href="#spiritual-ally" >spiritual ally</a></i> cannot be harmed by any physical attacks, but <i><a href="../../spells/dispelMagic.html#dispel-magic" >dispel magic</a></i>, <i><a href="../../spells/disintegrate.html#disintegrate" >disintegrate</a></i>, a <i>sphere of annihilation</i>, or a <i><a href="../../magicItems/rods.html#rod-of-cancellation" >rod of cancellation</a></i> affects it. A <i><a href="#spiritual-ally" >spiritual ally</a></i>'s AC against touch attacks is 10. </p>
				<p>If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the <i><a href="#spiritual-ally" >spiritual ally</a></i> strikes it. If the ally is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.</p>

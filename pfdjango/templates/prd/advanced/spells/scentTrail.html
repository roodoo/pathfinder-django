				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>School</b> transmutation; <b>Level</b> druid 2 </p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Casting Time</b> 1 standard action </p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Components</b> V, S, M (a queen ant)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Range </b>close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>
				<p id="targets-" class="stat-block-1"><b>Targets </b>one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Duration</b> 1 hour/level </p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Saving Throw</b> Fortitude negates (harmless); <b>Spell Resistance</b> yes (harmless)</p>
				<p>You, or a willing creature you touch, lay down a trail of scents that only the creatures you designate at the time of casting can detect. These creatures find it very easy to follow this trail. They gain a +20 competence bonus on any <a href="../../skills/survival.html#survival" >Survival</a> checks made for the purpose of tracking the creature laying this trail. Subject creatures with the scent special ability gain a +10 competence bonus on Wisdom or <a href="../../skills/survival.html#survival" >Survival</a> checks to follow the trail.</p>
				<p>In addition, you can leave scent messages along the trail. Each word or emotion in this message requires spending a move action in the same spot. Subject creatures seeking to understand this message must make another DC 20 <a href="../../skills/survival.html#survival" >Survival</a> check, with a &ndash;1 penalty for every word or emotion in the message, in order to understand it. Creatures cannot benefit from this smell if they cannot use, or do not have, a sense of smell. Creatures can use this spell to backtrack through a dungeon, maze, or similar areas even if the creature laying down the trail crossed over the spot multiple times. </p>

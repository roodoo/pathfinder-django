				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>School </b>necromancy [evil]; <b>Level </b>sorcerer/wizard 4</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Casting Time </b>1 minute</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Component </b>S</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Range </b>personal</p>

				<p>With this spell, you infuse your life force and psyche into your shadow, giving it independent life and movement as if it were an undead shadow (see <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary </i>245). Your physical body lies comatose while you are projecting your shadow, and your body has no shadow or reflection while the spell is in effect.</p>
				<p>While projecting your shadow, you gain a shadow's darkvision, defensive abilities, fly speed, racial stealth modifier, and strength damage attack. You do not gain the creature's <i>create spawn </i>ability, nor its skill ranks or Hit Dice. Your shadow has Hit Dice and hit points equal to your own. Your <i><a href="#shadow-projection" >shadow projection</a></i> has the undead type and may be turned or affected as undead.</p>
				<p>If your <i><a href="#shadow-projection" >shadow projection</a></i> is slain, you return to your physical body and are immediately reduced to &ndash;1 hit points. Your condition becomes dying, and you must begin making Constitution checks to stabilize.</p>

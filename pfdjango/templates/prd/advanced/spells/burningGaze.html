				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>School</b> evocation [fire]; <b>Level</b> druid 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, witch 2</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Casting Time</b> 1 standard action</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Components</b> V, S, M/DF (eye of a mundane salamander)</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Range</b> personal</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Target</b> you</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Duration</b> 1 round/level</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Saving Throw</b> Fortitude negates (see text); <b>Spell Resistance</b> yes</p>
				<p>Your eyes burn like hot coals, allowing you to set objects or foes alight with a glance.</p>
				<p>As a standard action as long as this spell's effects persist, you may direct your <i><a href="#burning-gaze" >burning gaze</a></i> against a single creature or object within 30 feet of your location. Targeted creatures must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of fire damage. Unattended objects do not get a save. Creatures damaged by the spell must make a Reflex save or catch fire. Each round, burning creatures may attempt a Reflex save to quench the flames; failure results in another 1d6 points of fire damage. Flammable items worn by a creature must also save or take the same damage as the creature. If a creature or object is already on fire, it suffers no additional effects from <i><a href="#burning-gaze" >burning gaze</a></i>.</p>
				<p>Note that this spell does not grant an actual gaze attack&mdash;foes and allies are not in danger of catching on fire simply by meeting your gaze. </p>

				<h1 id="sorcerer" class="monster-header">Sorcerer</h1>
				<p>Filled with magical power that screams for release, sorcery is not so much a calling as a blessing&mdash;or a curse. For some sorcerers, this arcane birthright manifests in subtle and carefully controlled ways, assisting in their manipulation of others or the pursuit of lofty goals. For others, it is wild and unpredictable, the primal and explosive lashing out of a power greater than themselves. Presented below are a number of new bloodlines representing the mysterious origin of your sorcerer's abilities. </p>
				<p>New spells presented in Chapter 5 are marked here with asterisks (*).</p>
				<h1 id="aquatic">Aquatic</h1>
				<p>Your family traces its heritage back to the ocean depths, whether scions of undersea empires left in the wake of nomadic sea-tribes, or the spawn of creeping ichthyic infiltrators into remote seaside villages. The song of the sea hums in your blood, calling the waves and all those within to your command.</p>

				<h1 id="dreamspun">Dreamspun</h1>
				<p>Your family is a long line of dreamers, who dream not as ordinary mortals do but rather as those who reach through and touch the supernal realm of dreams and the farthest shores of night.

				<h1 id="protean">Protean</h1>
				<p>You have in your veins the ever-changing wildness of primal chaos, the raw essence of unbound creation.

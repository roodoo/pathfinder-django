				<h1 id="monster-advancement">Monster Advancement</h1>
				<p>The following rules allow you to adjust monsters, increasing (or even decreasing) their statistics and abilities while still creating a balanced and fun encounter.</p>
				<h1 id="templates">Templates</h1>
				<p>A template is a set of rules that you apply to a monster to transform it into a different monster. It gives precise directions on how to change the original monster's statistics to transform it into the new monster.</p>
				<p><b>Acquired Templates</b>: This kind of template is added to a creature well after its birth or creation.</p>
				<p><b>Inherited Templates</b>: This kind of template is part of a creature from the beginning of its existence. Creatures are born or created with these templates already in place, and have never known life without them.</p>
				<h1 id="simple-templates">Simple Templates</h1>
				<p>Simple templates can be applied during the game with minimal effort. All simple templates have two categories of changes. The “quick rules” present a fast way to modify die rolls made in play to simulate the template's effects without actually rebuilding the stat block&mdash;this method works well for summoned creatures. The “rebuild rules” list the exact changes you make to the base stat block if you have the time to completely rebuild it&mdash;this method works best when you have time during game preparation to build full stat blocks. The two methods result in creatures of similar, if not identical, abilities.</p>
				<h2>Advanced Creature (CR +1)</h2>

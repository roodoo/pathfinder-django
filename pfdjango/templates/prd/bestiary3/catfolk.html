				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Cat's Luck (Ex) </b>Once per day when a catfolk makes a Reflex saving throw, it can roll the saving throw twice and take the better result. It must decide to use this ability before the saving throw is attempted.</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Sprinter (Ex)</b> A catfolk gains a 10-foot racial bonus to its speed when using the charge, run, or withdraw actions.</p>
				
				<p>Most catfolk are tribal hunter-gatherers who dwell in harmony with nature, though some tribes have acclimated well to urban environments. As a culture, catfolk are loyal, generous, and amiable. They like belonging to and being at harmony with a group whose members work together to accomplish their needs and wants. Tribal catfolk prefer for the most capable societal members to lead, so every tribe has a council of elevated subchiefs. A tribe's chief is usually the most competent (and magically talented) member of that tribe.</p>
				<p>Personal growth is part of catfolk culture, as is expression as a means of personal exploration. Catfolk have few taboos, and often exhibit harmless but strange eccentricities. Individuals cultivate a wide range of pursuits and self-expression, taking risks others might label unwise. Most individual catfolk like to be the center of attention, but not at the cost of group cohesion. </p>

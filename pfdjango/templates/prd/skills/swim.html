<h2>(<a href="../gettingStarted.html#strength" >Str</a>; Armor Check Penalty)</h2>				<p>You know how to swim and can do so even in stormy water.</p>
				<p><b>Check</b>: Make a Swim check once per round while you are in the water. Success means you may swim at up to half your speed (as a full-round action) or at a quarter of your speed (as a move action). If you fail by 4 or less, you make no progress. If you fail by 5 or more, you go underwater.</p>
				<p>If you are underwater, either because you failed a Swim check or because you are swimming underwater intentionally, you must hold your breath. You can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to twice your <a href="../gettingStarted.html#constitution" >Constitution</a> score, but only if you do nothing other than take move actions or free actions. If you take a standard action or a full-round action (such as making an attack), the remainder of the duration for which you can hold your breath is reduced by 1 round. (Effectively, a character in combat can hold his breath only half as long as normal.) After that period of time, you must make a DC 10 <a href="../gettingStarted.html#constitution" >Constitution</a> check every round to continue holding your breath. Each round, the DC for that check increases by 1. If you fail the <a href="../gettingStarted.html#constitution" >Constitution</a> check, you begin to drown. The DC for the Swim check depends on the water, as given on the table below.</p><table>
<thead><tr><th>Water</th><th>Swim DC</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd"><td>Calm water</td><td>10</td></tr>
<tr class="even"><td>Rough water</td><td>15</td></tr>
<tr class="odd"><td>Stormy water</td><td>20*</td></tr></tbody>
<tfoot><tr><td colspan="2">* You can't take 10 on a Swim check in stormy water, even if you aren't otherwise being threatened or distracted.</td></tr>
</tfoot></table>				<p>Each hour that you swim, you must make a DC 20 Swim check or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage from fatigue.</p>
				<p><b>Action</b>: A successful Swim check allows you to swim a quarter of your speed as a move action or half your speed as a full-round action.</p>
				<p><b>Special</b>: A creature with a swim speed can move through water at its indicated speed without making Swim checks. It gains a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform a special action or avoid a hazard. The creature can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered when swimming. Such a creature can use the run action while swimming, provided that it swims in a straight line.</p>
				<p>If you have the <a href="../feats.html#athletic" >Athletic</a> feat, you get a bonus on Swim checks (see <a href="../feats.html">Feats</a>).</p>

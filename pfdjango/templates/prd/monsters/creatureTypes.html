A creature that travels the planes can gain or lose this subtype as it goes from plane to plane. Monster entries assume that encounters with creatures take place on the Material Plane, and every creature whose native plane is not the Material Plane has the extraplanar subtype (but would not have it when on its home plane). Every extraplanar creature in this book has a home plane mentioned in its description. Creatures not labeled as extraplanar are natives of the Material Plane, and they gain the extraplanar subtype if they leave the Material Plane.

				<p id="good-subtype"><b>Good Subtype</b>: This subtype is usually applied to outsiders native to the good-aligned outer planes. Most creatures that have this subtype also have good alignments; however, if their alignments change, they still retain the subtype.

				<p id="lawful-subtype"><b>Lawful Subtype</b>: This subtype is usually applied to outsiders native to the lawfully aligned outer planes.

The creature also suffers effects according to its actual alignment. A creature with the lawful subtype overcomes damage reduction as if its natural weapons and any weapons it wields are lawfully aligned (see Damage Reduction, page 299).</p>
				<p id="native-subtype"><b>Native Subtype</b>: This subtype is applied only to outsiders. These creatures have mortal ancestors or a strong connection to the Material Plane and can be raised, reincarnated, or resurrected just as other living creatures can be. Creatures with this subtype are native to the Material Plane. Unlike true outsiders, native outsiders need to eat and sleep. </p>
				<p id="orc-subtype"><b>Orc Subtype</b>: This subtype is applied to orcs and creatures related to orcs, such as half-orcs. Creatures with the orc subtype have darkvision 60 feet and light sensitivity (half-orcs do not have light sensitivity).</p>
				<p id="reptilian-subtype"><b>Reptilian Subtype</b>: These creatures are scaly and usually cold-blooded. The reptilian subtype is only used to describe a set of <a href="#humanoid" >humanoid</a> races, not all animals and monsters that are true reptiles.</p>
				<p id="shapechanger-subtype"><b>Shapechanger Subtype</b>: A shapechanger has the supernatural ability to assume one or more alternate forms.

				<ul><li> Proficient with its natural weapons, with simple weapons, and with any weapons mentioned in the creature's description.</li>
				<li> Proficient with any armor mentioned in the creature's description, as well as all lighter forms. If no form of armor is mentioned, the shapechanger is not proficient with armor. A shapechanger is proficient with shields if it is proficient with any type of armor.</li></ul>
				<p id="swarm-subtype"><b>Swarm Subtype</b>: A swarm is a collection of Fine, Diminutive, or Tiny creatures that acts as a single creature. A swarm has the characteristics of its type, except as noted here. A swarm has a single pool of Hit Dice and hit points, a single initiative modifier, a single speed, and a single Armor Class. A swarm makes saving throws as a single creature. A single swarm occupies a square (if it is made up of nonflying creatures) or a cube (of flying creatures) 10 feet on a side, but its reach is 0 feet, like its component creatures. In order to attack, it moves into an opponent's space, which provokes an attack of opportunity. It can occupy the same space as a creature of any size, since it crawls all over its prey. A swarm can move through squares occupied by enemies and vice versa without impediment, although the swarm provokes an attack of opportunity if it does so. A swarm can move through cracks or holes large enough for its component creatures.</p>
				<p>A swarm of Tiny creatures consists of 300 nonflying creatures or 1,000 flying creatures. A swarm of Diminutive creatures consists of 1,500 nonflying creatures or 5,000 flying creatures. A swarm of Fine creatures consists of 10,000 creatures, whether they are flying or not. Swarms of nonflying creatures include many more creatures than could normally fit in a 10-foot square based on their normal space, because creatures in a swarm are packed tightly together and generally crawl over each other and their prey when moving or attacking. Larger swarms are represented by multiples of single swarms. The area occupied by a large swarm is completely shapeable, though the swarm usually remains in contiguous squares.</p>
				<p><i>Swarm Traits</i>: A swarm has no clear front or back and no discernable anatomy, so it is not subject to critical hits or flanking. A swarm made up of Tiny creatures takes half damage from slashing and piercing weapons. A swarm composed of Fine or Diminutive creatures is immune to all weapon damage. Reducing a swarm to 0 hit points or less causes it to break up, though damage taken until that point does not degrade its ability to attack or resist attack. Swarms are never staggered or reduced to a dying state by damage. Also, they cannot be tripped, grappled, or bull rushed, and they cannot grapple an opponent.</p>
				<p>A swarm is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as <i><a href="../spells/disintegrate.html#disintegrate" >disintegrate</a></i>), with the exception of mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, morale effects, patterns, and phantasms) if the swarm has an Intelligence score and a hive mind. A swarm takes half again as much damage (+50%) from spells or effects that affect an area, such as splash weapons and many evocation spells.</p>
				<p>Swarms made up of Diminutive or Fine creatures are susceptible to high winds, such as those created by a <i><a href="../spells/gustOfWind.html#gust-of-wind" >gust of wind</a> </i>spell. For purposes of determining the effects of wind on a swarm, treat the swarm as a creature of the same size as its constituent creatures. A swarm rendered unconscious by means of nonlethal damage becomes disorganized and dispersed, and does not reform until its hit points exceed its nonlethal damage.</p>
				<p><i>Swarm Attack</i>: Creatures with the swarm subtype don't make standard melee attacks. Instead, they deal automatic damage to any creature whose space they occupy at the end of their move, with no attack roll needed. Swarm attacks are not subject to a miss chance for concealment or cover. A swarm's statistics block has “swarm” in the Melee entry, with no attack bonus given. The amount of damage a swarm deals is based on its Hit Dice, as shown below.</p><table>
<thead><tr><th>Swarm HD</th><th>Swarm Base Damage</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd"><td>1&ndash;5</td><td>1d6</td></tr>
<tr class="even"><td>6&ndash;10</td><td>2d6</td></tr>
<tr class="odd"><td>11&ndash;15</td><td>3d6</td></tr>
<tr class="even"><td>16&ndash;20</td><td>4d6</td></tr>
<tr class="odd"><td>21 or more</td><td>5d6</td></tr></tbody></table>				<p>A swarm's attacks are nonmagical, unless the swarm's description states otherwise. Damage reduction sufficient to reduce a swarm attack's damage to 0, being incorporeal, or other special abilities usually give a creature immunity (or at least resistance) to damage from a swarm. Some swarms also have acid, blood drain, poison, or other special attacks in addition to normal damage.</p>
				<p>Swarms do not threaten creatures, and do not make attacks of opportunity with their swarm attack. However, they distract foes whose squares they occupy, as described below.</p>
				<p>Swarms possess the distraction universal monster rule. Spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the area of a swarm requires a caster level check (DC 20 + spell level). Using skills that involve patience and concentration requires a DC 20 Will save.</p>
				<p id="water-subtype"><b>Water Subtype:</b> This subtype is usually used for outsiders with a connection to the Elemental Plane of Water. Creatures with the water subtype always have swim speeds and can move in water without making <a href="../skills/swim.html#swim" >Swim</a> checks. A water creature can breathe underwater and can usually breathe air as well. Water creatures treat the <a href="../skills/swim.html#swim" >Swim</a> skill as a class skill.</p>
